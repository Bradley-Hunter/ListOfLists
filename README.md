# Overview

This project is a program that demonstrates basic proficentcy in the Java programming language. This progam will take a filename from a user and then using that file if it exists, it will through input from the user form a HashMap object containing a key of a String and a value of an ArrayList object which contains a list of strings. The User is capable of adding and removing lists and are also able to modify the lists themselves. Then after the user is ready to be done the program will ask the user for a filename to save the list to.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add a GUI to project
* Perform a Check on the Object conversion to a HashMap<String, ArrayList\<String>> object instead of a unchecked conversion.
